# Data Science References and Learning Materials

With a goal of continual learning and improvement, 
we suggest spending a small portion of each week reading about and practicing
new data science tools and techniques.

The following resources may be a good place to start for exploring new topics.

## General References

1. The Data Science Team has collected a number of different 
[data science related cheat sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mF1qvG8lkqNLvsgomOU9KEWxzyRV1PUT) in 
Google Drive.

2. Also in the Data Science Team Google Drive, are some downloadable
[data science related books](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRtxaB6a_8_edZKc8sC3_cM6SuUOhoU-).

3. [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/newsletters) does a weekly data science 
newsletter that covers a variety of topics. You can find the latest newsletter, as well as an 
archive of previous newsletters on their site.

4. [Kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) contains many different tutorials and blog posts
related to data science.

5. [Open Data Science](https://opendatascience.com/) is another good site with many different topics
including data modeling and different data science tools.


## References Specific to Diabetes Data

In addition to keeping up with data science developments and best practices, we also
encourage devoting time to getting familiar with and reading the latest
research on diabetes data.

There are many avenues to do this at Tidepool. One is through the weekly Data Science Learning group, 
which covers a variety of diabetes data related topics and can be a good way to learn more
about research in the field. Papers from this group are shared via a google group email
address (learning-group@tidepool.org), as well as on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (contact the
Data Science Team for an invitation to either platform, if needed). 

## Data Visualization

For references specific to data visualization best practices and tools, see
the [Data Visualization Guide](https://github.com/tidepool-org/data-science-handbook/blob/master/cheat-sheets/data-visualization.md) 
of the Data Science Handbook.
