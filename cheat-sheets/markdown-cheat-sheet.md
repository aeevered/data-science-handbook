### Introduction to MarkDown

MarkDown is a markup language that allows you to write structured documents (i.e. defining headers, bullets, 
and other style features) in plain text. Most files in the Data Science Handbook are MarkDown files (.md extension)
and the team also uses MarkDown, for example, for structuring text cells of Google Colab notebooks.
