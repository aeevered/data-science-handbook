# Communication Tips
## Decision Making

### Use the Negotiating Scale (Credit to Howard Look)

(Examples used while building a house)

1. I have no opinion and just don’t care. Do whatever you want.
2. I have a very, very mild opinion about this, but defer to you. (e.g., kitchen tile)
3. I have opinions. We should talk. I’d like to learn more. I’ll probably be looking at that every day and wonder about 
   it, and it’s hard to reverse (e.g., house color)
4. I feel really strongly about this, but not so strongly that it would outweigh one of your 5's.
   (e.g., ice maker in the refrigerator)
5. This is a dig in my heels, I’ll veto if I don’t get my way.
