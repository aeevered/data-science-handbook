# Pycharm Tips
* If you navigate to the View option on the Menu Bar, you can select various view options, 
such as "Enter Presentation Mode,"  which increases the font size of your code to 
make it easier for your audience to view, or "Enter Distraction Free Mode," where the editor occupies 
the entire main window. See [PyCharm Viewing Modes ](
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/ide-viewing-modes.html) for more. You can also [Configure Shortcuts](
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html) configure shortcuts to 
switch between the different view modes. From the View menu, you can also select and deselect which menu elements
you want in the main view.
* You can [export and share your PyCharm settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-sharing-product-settings.html), for example if you want to configure PyCharm similarly on 
multiple devices.
* PyCharm also has a set of built in [tools for formatting and styling your code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-code-quality-assistance-tips-and-tricks.html).
* You can search both [within a file](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/finding-and-replacing-text-in-file.html) 
and [within a whole project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/finding-and-replacing-text-in-project.html).
