# Data Science Team Governance
Last updated May 1, 2020 by Ed Nykaza, Jason Meno, and Cameron Summers

## Purpose
The purpose of this governance document is to document how the Tidepool Data Science Team operates. We firmly believe 
in radical transparency and continual improvement. As such, this is a living document that should be helpful for anyone 
that wants to contribute to the data science team.

## Team Philosophies
* Always put the diabetes community and Tidepool before your ego. In fact, you don’t work for Tidepool, you work for 
the diabetes community. This job is a privilege.
* Continually learn and share what you learn. The more we can share back to the diabetes community the more we can help 
speed up innovation.
* Demonstrate rather than abstractate (yep, totally a made up word :). There are a lot of smart people that have really 
great ideas that never got past the idea phase because they spent their energy thinking (abstracting) instead of 
prototyping the idea, demonstrating, getting feedback, and iterating (being agile).
* Be Radically transparent and radically candid (Scott, 2017). Give open and honest feedback sooner than later because 
you care.
* Go slow to go fast. Document and share everything, and keep things clean and concise (less is more). 
Everything includes code, data, papers/references. Take the time to document code and be pedantic about version control. 
Take the extra time to make code readable and reproducible, so we are not actively creating technical debt. 
* As a team we should challenge, debate, agree/disagree, and then commit.
* The four agreements [borrowed from (Ruiz, 1997)]
    * Be impeccable with your word. If you say you are going to do something, then do it, or renegotiate sooner than later.
    * Don’t take anything too seriously. While it is true that the work we are doing is super important and that it is 
    super important that we get the details correct because people’s lives depend on it, we will not be useful to the 
    diabetes community, Tidepool, and the Tidepool Data Science Team if we are not in a sound mind and body. Take the 
    time to take care of yourself (e.g., get enough sleep, exercise, fuel, and mental well being).
    * Don’t make assumptions.
    * Always do your best and be ok with the fact that your best will vary over time.
* Commit to having the best data science team (see Project Aristotle for reference):
    * Psychological Safety – team members feel safe to take risks, make mistakes, and be vulnerable in front of each 
    other. 
    * Above average social sensitivity — ability to know how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions 
    and other nonverbal cues.
    * Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking — team members speak in roughly the same proportion.
    * Radical Candor (Scott, 2017)— giving timely, honest, feedback in a caring way because you care
    * Conflict is often good (Fisher et al., 1991) and important for growth (Dweck, 2006). However, must properly manage 
    conflict:
        * People: Separate people from the problem
        * Interests: Focus on interests not positions
        * Options: Come up with multiple solutions to consider
        * Criteria: Insist that the results be based on some objective standard
    * Agile — able to adapt and renegotiate.
    * Learn by doing (test & learn iteratively)
    * Share & demonstrate what you learn
    * Communication — communicate, even about stressful issues and topics. 
    * Have Fun
    * Be Professional
        * Get things done on time
        * Have clear team & individual expectations, roles, plans, and goals
    * Improve the system
        * It is everyone’s job to improve our data science system.
        * Create checklists (Gawande, 2011), templates, and cheat-sheets
        * Share knowledge, insights, lessons-learned, and potential-pitfalls
        * It is your job to improve yourself. Here is a link to some of 
        [Ed’s favorite books](https://live-learn-lead.com/recommended-reading/). 
    * Code to the highest standard:
        * Document your code.
        * Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
        * Reuse code via import (don’t copy and paste)
        * Write tests (unit and integration tests)
        * Don’t write code that is immediately in a state of tech debt.
        * Choice — having the best team is a choice and something we all have to work at.
