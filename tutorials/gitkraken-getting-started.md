# GitKraken Getting Started Guide

GitKraken is a free Git GUI Client for Windows, Mac and Linux 
that the Data Science Team uses to track and manage code changes.

In particular, the GitKraken UI provides a nice visualization for seeing branches and
code changes for a given repository.

## Logging In

When you open the GitKraken application for the first time, you 
will be prompted via a welcome screen to sign in or create a new account.

You will likely want to sign in to GitKraken with your GitHub credentials instead
of creating a new GitKraken account. 

To do so, select the "Sign in with GitHub" button and enter your GitHub credentials.

GitKraken makes cloning repositories from GitHub relatively straightforward. 
To do so, 

1. Click the Repo Menu (folder icon in the upper left corner)
2. Select Clone
3. Select where to clone from (i.e. GitHub)
4. Select where to clone the repository to on your local machine and search for the
repository name.
5. Select "Clone the repo!"


## Best Practices
