# GitKraken Getting Started Guide

GitKraken is a free Git GUI Client for Windows, Mac and Linux 
that the Data Science Team uses to track and manage code changes.

In particular, the GitKraken UI provides a nice visualization for seeing branches and
code changes for a given repository. 

## Downloading GitKraken

1. Navigate to the [GitKraken Download Page](https://www.gitkraken.com/download).

2. Select the download for your operating system. 
   
    (Note: you can watch the [GitKraken Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9GfRziCtU)) video while you wait).

3. Double-click the downloaded executable file.

4. Follow the installation instructions.

For more information on downloading GitKraken on different systems, 
as well as on system requirements, see the 
[GitKraken Installation Support Article](
https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/)

## Logging In

When you open the GitKraken application for the first time, you 
will be prompted via a welcome screen to sign in or create a new account.

You will likely want to sign in to GitKraken with your GitHub credentials instead
of creating a new GitKraken account. 

To do so, select the "Sign in with GitHub" button and enter your GitHub credentials.


## Cloning a Repository

GitKraken makes cloning repositories from GitHub relatively straightforward. 

To do so, 

1. Click the Repo Menu (folder icon in the upper left corner)

   This will likely already be the first screen you see when you login to GitKraken for the first time. 
    
2. Select Clone.
3. Select where to clone from (i.e. GitHub).
4. Select where to clone the repository to on your local machine and search for the
repository name.
5. Select "Clone the repo!"


## Staging and Committing Changes

When you make changes to a local repository on a particular branch, you will see uncommitted
changes reflected in the GitKraken interface.

Follow the steps in this [GitKraken tutorial on committing changes](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-commits/commits/) to commit these changes.

## Creating a Pull Request
1. Drag and drop your feature branch onto the main branch to access the pull request option.
2. Fill in the details and click "Create a Pull Request."

OR

1. Click the "+" sign next to the PULL REQUESTS section on the left side of the screen. 
2. Fill in the details and click "Create a Pull Request."


GitKraken also provides a helpful 
[video on creating a pull request](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pull-requests/),
which outline these two ways of creating a pull request.
