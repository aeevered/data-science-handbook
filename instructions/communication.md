#Team Communication and Project Management

## Communication Channels

* The Data Science Team uses a **google group**
(data-science@tidepool.org) for email communications to the whole team. This address should also be used
when needing to invite the entire team to a meeting.

* There is also a calendar associated
with this group, accessible through a direct invite URL.
This **Team Calendar** is a way to keep track of our recurring events 
(sprint structure, who is presenting at what all-hands/show-and-tell), 
but does not replace the personal calendar events themselves.

* We also use a **team specific Slack channel** (#tidepool-data-science) accessible to
anyone at Tidepool. This is a good place to share short updates, challenges, 
and other team notifications. Longer conversations should be moved to a more 
permanent place, though, like Google docs or into Jira cards.

* Each team member should keep a **living notes doc** with a brief daily update and other notes
so that everyone can see what we are up to. Sharing ideas 
and asking questions of coworkers is also often best done in 
living notes, as it allows the idea and question to be asked and dealt with asynchronously.

* **Jira** is a space for the framework of our projects; the details of our work can 
live within living notes.

* Create Jira tickets for new work or requests
and continue to manage personal or one off things on our **own to do lists.**

* If you need an immediate response, please note this (in Slack, etc.); otherwise, 
we assume itâ€™s not immediately urgent.

## Updating Jira Cards

* We want to find a balance in terms of how frequently to update cards.
For example, we probably don't want to update cards a few times a day, 
but also don't want to just update them once a sprint.

* For now, aim for looking at Jira cards every day and updating cards at least a few times a week.

* In general, keep Jira cards small in scope.

## Out of Office

* If you are planning to be out of the office for an entire day, 
update the Tidepool OOO calendar and your personal calendar. 

* Use Slack statuses to indicate both short term availability (away from desk, lunch, etc.) and
when you are out of office for longer time periods or for the whole day.
