#Team Communications

I created data-science@tidepool.org google group and also created a calendar under my profile.
Team Calendar is used as a way to keep track of our recurring events (sprint structure, who is presenting at what all-hands/show-and-tell), but does not replace the personal calendar events themselves.

Access to the Team Calendar is through a direct invite URL
Use the data-science@tidepool.org group to invite entire team when needed
How frequently should we be updating jira tickets?
We all agree that we need to find a good balance. Probably not every day, and not one time a sprint.
As a team we will shoot for updating a few times a week
We should keep cards smaller
We are going to try to look at cards every day.



## Sharing Notes, Questions and Comments

* Each team member keeps a living notes doc so that everyone can see what we are up to. Sharing ideas 
and asking questions of coworkers is also often best done in 
living notes, as it allows the idea and question to be asked and dealt with asynchronously.

## Updating Jira cards

How do we want to let each other know when we are out of the office, when we are available to chat, are we going to have daily schedules? 
We will use slack for our immediate and long term status
For planned OOOs update your personal tidepool calendar
If we need an immediate response. Say it in whatever you call it, otherwise assume it’s not urgent.
Here are some general Tidepool rules of thumb:
If you are going to be out of the office for an entire day, update the Tidepool OOO calendar and your personal calendar. Though I can’t remember what was the decided the last time this was brought up as Tidepool is getting pretty large and the OOO calendar is getting quite big
Set a slack status
