# Meeting Instructions

## Meetings Best Practices
* Meetings should have good agendas and purposes.
* We will try recording sessions.

When someone misses a meeting we should make a point to let the person know if there is information in the meeting they 
When someone is giving a presentation or talking it would be cool if one person took notes and one person was keeping an eye on the chat.


Jira is a space for the framework of our projects, and the details of our work can live within living notes
Keeping data science updates for the rest of the team to be moderate in frequency, and minimizing the number of meetings in our schedules


## Recurring meeting schedule

(A) Biweekly sprint planning meetings on Monday (data science team only), where we plan out the next two weeks of work
(B) Biweekly sprint meeting on Tuesdays (data science team and project management team)
(C) Biweekly update at All Hands Meeting. We should take turns giving this high-level presentation to larger Tidepool Team. Updates should go on our confluence page, and we can walk through those updates 
(D) Biweekly diabetes data science team meeting. We should take turns leading this meeting.
(E) Biweekly data science team open hour on Thursdays before the end of the sprint to share what we’ve done with any internal tidepool folks that might be interested. The purpose of these meetings is to get into the nerdy details for those that are interested.
(F) Biweekly presentation at Tidepool Show and Tell. The purpose of this presentation is to share what the data science team is up to at a very high level. I think that we should take turns, which essentially means that each of us would be on the hook to present at least once every 6 weeks.
(G) 10% Time Fridays -- work on whatever you want and let’s share at the end of the day. 
(H) Thursday Stand up and show and tell.
L is the person that will lead the meeting. Given that there are currently 3 of us, we can rotate and divide and conquer.
