# Meeting Instructions

## Meeting Best Practices
* Meetings should have good agendas and clear purposes.

* For now, we will record most meeting sessions for future reference. 

* When someone misses a meeting, we make a point to let the person 
know if there is specific information in the meeting they should know.

* When someone is giving a presentation or talking, ideally one other person should take notes and 
one person should keep an eye on the chat.

* In the case of recurring meetings, you can start taking notes in the Google doc 
specific to that recurring meeting (for example, Data Science Team Notes [LIVING]). If the notes 
get rather large, though, good practice is to move the notes to another location, title them 
with the specific topic and include a link to them in the original doc.

## Meeting Responsibilities

* **The meeting organizer is responsible for:**
    
    * Taking the first pass at defining the purpose, success criteria, and agenda.

    * Sending the agenda out ahead of the meeting.

    * Scheduling the meeting.
    
    * Recording the meeting (if applicable and agreed upon by all members) 
    and making the recording available to all participants.

    * Summarizing the next actions, putting the next actions on one of our next action lists.

    * Creating a google doc for the meeting and putting them in our shared meeting notes directory.

* **Everyone is responsible for:**

    * Being engaged and not distracted, or leaving the meeting if you have nothing to add or learn.

    * Taking notes.

    * Pausing the meeting to capture action items.

    * Monitoring chat and putting links in chat in the meeting notes.

    * Interrupting someone if they are dominating the conversation.


## Recurring Meetings

**The following is a list of recurring Data Science related meetings.**

(A) Biweekly sprint planning meetings on Monday (data science team only), 
where we plan out the next two weeks of work.

(B) Biweekly sprint meeting on Tuesdays (data science team and project management team).

(C) Biweekly update at All Hands Meeting. We should take turns giving this high-level 
presentation to larger Tidepool Team. Updates should go on our confluence page, and

The purpose of these meetings is to get into the nerdy details for those that are interested.

(F) Biweekly presentation at Tidepool Show and Tell. 
The purpose of this presentation is to share what the data science team 
is up to at a very high level. We should take turns presenting
essentially means that each of us would be on the hook to present at least once every 6 weeks.
