# Pull Request and Code Review Process

The following page outlines the Data Science Team's guidelines for submitting pull requests and
reviewing code.

## Author Checklist
Before submitting a pul request, consider:

  * Can the reviewer move quickly? 

  * Is the README file there? 

  * Is the code organized well and understandable?
      
  * Does the style follow the Data Science Team's guidelines?


## Reviewer Checklist
When reviewing someone else's code, be sure to check that:

* The code runs.

* There are no obvious errors.

* There is test coverage.

## Code Review Process Options for Feedback

You have several options for providing feedback when doing a code review:

1. For general comments, you can use the comment mode.

2. If you are making a very small change to an existing line or lines of adjacent code, use the GitHub suggestion mode.

3. If you want to make larger changes, then create a branch off of the branch being reviewed and let the team know in Slack.

## Other Best Practices and Guidelines
The following best practices have been decided on by the Data Science Team. However, these practices are
a work in progress and may be revised and added to based on team feedback.
* Code that will be reused should have small and frequent pull requests and reviews. 
Unicorns, one-offs, and exploratory “stuff” do not need to be reviewed as frequently.
* Code with the reviewer in mind.
* It is up to each individual to decide how frequently to submit pull requests and to set the expectations on how soon
they need the review done by.
* Keep in mind that in some cases, the pull request process may be made easier through in-person review.
* If a code review is going to take more than a few hours, make a jira ticket and treat it as a task. 
This is particularly true if it is a formal piece of code (e.g., risk analysis for FDA), rather than something
more exploratory.
* Consider adding context with your pull request for what you are hoping to get out of the review or 
 anything you would like the reviewer to focus on.
