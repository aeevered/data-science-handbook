# Using G-Suite

## Google Calendar
Although Slack updates serve as a good tool to keep track of immediate status, we use the Tidepool google calendar to
 keep team members updated about OOOs, when we are available to chat, and general scheduling.
 
There are two main calendars of importance: personal calendars and the data science team calendar.
In general, if you are going to be out of the office for a full day, mark it in the data science team calendar and your
 personal calendar. Otherwise, mark your shorter OOO in just your personal calendar.
