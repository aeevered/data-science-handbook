# Naming Conventions

## General Format
For files and folders created within the Tidepool Google Drive or locally, documents should be named as follows:
<[PHI]> <[OBSOLETE]> <[AUDIENCE]> <[STATUS]> <ONE WORD DESCRIPTION> <DETAILS>

## Common Labels
* PHI: If there is PHI then this label must be included at the beginning of every file and folder name.
* OBSOLETE: This label should mark out of date documents.
* Audience:
    * Default: None or Blank
    * INTERNAL ONLY: For use when the material in the document is sensitive and for Tidepool eyes only.
    * EXTERNAL: Marks a document shared with people outside of Tidepool.
    * PUBLIC: Marks a document shared with the world.
* Status: 
    * Date Created (YYYY-MM-DD): The data science team uses this convention for meeting notes.
    * LIVING: Marks a document that is in progress and continuously updated.
    * WIP: Marks a document that is incomplete and therefore still a work in progress.
    * CFD: Marks a document that is a crappy first draft.
    * DRAFT (v0.X): Marks the draft version.
    * FINAL: The final draft, assumed v1.0 version.
    
## Dashes, Spaces, Underscores?
Dashes should be used when possible within filename descriptions and details.
